# Web programming course
### Reykjav√≠k university

In this course we began by learning basic html/css and javascript.
As th course progressed it became more javascript focused and more advanced.

In project DT1 we made a frontend using only css and html.

In projects DT2 things quickly became more advanced with javascript and ajax where we were to implement a functioning script for a todo-list application where the requirements were quite difficult, one of which was adding a drag and drop functionality where we could drag task from one board to another and the change would be reflected in the provided backend.

In Projects DT3 we created the same backend using javascript with express that was provided in DT2, this was a great learning experience getting to know CRUD and REST-apis better.

In projcts DT4 We tested the backend using javascripts mocha  for unit testing.
